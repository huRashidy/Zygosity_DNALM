# Zygosity_DNALM

Zygosity-aware DNA language models leverage both haplotypes to improve ancestry and gene expression prediction. This repo provides HyenaDNA, CNNs, and Nucleotide Transformer-based code, embeddings generation, classification head training scripts, and example data to reproduce the study's key results.
